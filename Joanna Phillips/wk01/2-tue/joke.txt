So a cop is sitting by the side of a road and he sees someone drving past with a busload of penguins.

Suspicious, the cop pulls the guy over and says 'what are you doing with these penguins?'

The guy says 'i'm taking these penguins to the zoo' to which the cop says 'fair enough, on your way'

The next week, the cop is sat by the side of the road and he sees the same guy driving past with a busload of penguins again.

He pulls the guy over and says 'i thought you were taking these penguins to the zoo?' the guy says 'yeah i was, and this week i'm taking them to the cinema!'
